# EV-cleaning-and-analysis :
  Analyse the Electric and extract meaningful insights like top acceleration car brand ,
  correlation brtween range and battery capacity etc.

# Dataset :
  source : kaggle
  columns : Brand,Model,Range,Battery Capacity etc.
  size : 477 rows x 22 columns

#  Data cleaning steps :
  1. Removed duplicates from record
  2. Handled missing values by fillna and dropna methods as required.

# Analysis :
  1. top 5 car brands with top speed
  2. Most popular body type
  3. top car brands with highest number of EV (bar plot)
  4. Correlation between range and battery capacity

# Key insight :
  1. SUV is the most popular body type.
  2. Mercedes-Benz has most number of ev cars with 42 units.
  3. Their is strong positive correlation between range and battery capacity
  4. Porsche(Taycan Turbo GT Weissach) is the car who reach from 0 to 100 km/hr in just 2.2 sec.

# Tools and Libraries :
  1. Python
  2. Pandas and NumPy (data cleaning)
